### Summary

1. There are 72,458 employees who will be retiring soon. All of these roles will need to be filled. Refer to table unique_titles.
2. There are currently 1,549 employees who are eligible to become mentors. This should be enough to mentor the next generation of workers if they were to allocate enough resources to create a new department for mentorship and handle the load in small waves. Refer to table employee_count.
