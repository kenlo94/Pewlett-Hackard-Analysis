    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">First, I created a new database on the

    </p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">Next, I created the structure of the database and
        defined the relationships between its objects, also known as the schema.</p>

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">The image above displays the code required to
        create the table schema for the six csv files. The data types have been specified for each column of each table,
        foreign keys have been referenced, and primary keys have been designated. <strong>Please note</strong> that some
        primary keys are <em>composite keys</em> because it takes more than one column to uniquely identify a row. This
        is because some values appear more than once in each column.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="34">After I executed the code for the schema, I began
        importing each csv file into its corresponding SQL table. To avoid errors, I imported the csv files in the same

        the <strong><em>IN</em></strong> keyword within the <strong><em>WHERE</em></strong> clause since I am interested
